Hey! I'm @Grom-Thunderfist, a young aspiring programmer who loves nothing more than the success of a program you've spent hours on.
I'm still learning, and I'm not going to be done for quite some team considering I'm not even done with middle school.

I started off on khan academy, then moved over to Jvascript. I didn't really dive into it too deep, which is a problem I often have.
Nowday's I'm learning Java and doing some blender projects

If you have any suggestions, I'm open :D
